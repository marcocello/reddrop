## Overview

Reddit is one of the most powerful platforms for idea exchange, product discovery, and community insight — but it's built in a way that makes strategic participation challenging.

Posts often go unnoticed unless the user already has strong karma or community presence. Many subreddits restrict posting entirely to new users. And while commenting is always an option, finding the right thread, in the right subreddit, with the right tone, is far from simple.
